    <p>And now the end is near &#x1f97a<br> And so i face the final curtain&#x1f614</p>
    <p>My friend say it clear &#x1f623<br>I'll state my case,<br>of which i'm certain&#x1f614</p>
    <p>I've live a life that's full &#x1f979<br> I traveled each and every higway&#x1f972</p>
    <p>And more, much more than this,<br>I did it may way.&#x1f97a</p>
    <p>Regrets, I've had a few<br> But then again too few to mention.</p>
    <p>I did what i had to do<br>And saw it through whithout exemption</p>
    <p>I planned ech charted course<br>Each careful step along the byway.</p>
    <p>And more, much more than this<br> I did it my way.</p>

    <p>Yes, there were times<br>I'm sure you knew</p>
    <p>When i bit off more tha<br>I could chew</p>
    <p>But through it all,<br>when there was doubt</p>
    <p>I ate it up and spit it out</p>
    <p>I faced it all and i stood tall <br>And did it my way</p>

    <p>I've loved,I've laughed and cried<br>I've had my fill, my share of losing.</p>
    <p>And now, as tears subside<br>I find it all so amusing</p>
    <p>To think i did all that<br>And may i say, not in a shy way.</p>
    <p>Oh,no, oh no, not me,<br>I did it my way.</p>

    <p>For what is a man,<br>what has he got?</p>
    <p>If not himself then he has naught<br>to say the things that he truly feels</p>
    <p>And not the words of one who kneels<br>The record shows, i took the blows</p>
    <p>And did it my way!</p>
